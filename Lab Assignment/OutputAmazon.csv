Elizabeth,"March 12, 2024","I like the colors SO MUCH, they're super retro, and the cream color is *chef's kiss* perfect, and it fits my retro aesthetic perfectly :) Keeps my water icy cold all day, I like that you can collapse the ""straw"" thing, which makes it feel more sanitary than the cups that have the straw sticking straight up at all times. Super easy to clean, it's heavy, but it helps me stay hydrated so yay. I also like the Stanley brand, they can take a beating and still hold up pretty well."
Mary Alice,"February 17, 2024","in my opinion the best yet stanley tumbler. ‚ú® it‚Äôs made of recycled fishing nets (my biggest conservation interest), i adore the leak proof flip straw, it keeps my ice for 2 entire days, the 30oz is perfect if you‚Äôre petite/have small hands/aren‚Äôt very strong, the handle makes it easy to carry around everywhere, it holds ice to the top and a normal sized water bottle perfectly, the color selection is immaculate especially on amazon (i bought a second one in the plum stripe color tonight), and it‚Äôs sweat proof. next i think i‚Äôll be purchasing a 64oz in the charcoal or lavender just to have on hand for long trips, beach days, camping, etc.,i really can‚Äôt imagine a more perfect every day water bottle. the only con for me is they did that collab with starbucks in the beginning of this year and with the goings on in üáµüá∏ üçâ i really did not like that - if you know you know - but making this from the recycled fishing nets is really something im glad to support because saving our oceans and our planet is so important and i wish more big corporations would be willing to participate and do the same. the fishing industry and the nets they litter everywhere are the biggest cause of oceanic pollution, there‚Äôs millions of giant fishing vessels üö¢ net sweeping the entire ocean floor at every second of every day killing every animal caught inside including endangered & non target species such as dolphins, sea turtles, & thousands of others. this continuous hacking at our oceans has reduced our coral reef and fish populations along with algae production by 70% in the last 50 years (most of the worlds oxygen comes from algae). their nets are the number ONE source of plastic in our oceans making up 80% of the plastic found at sea (straws only make up 1% for reference). so thank you stanley for doing something helpful to our planet! üåé üåä"
Justin Nola,"March 22, 2024","Looks exactly like the picture, LEGIT BRAND!,Keeps my water cold for hours, sometimes more than a day depending on how cold the water I put in or how much ice I put in. The first bottle I got it had a small scratch, so I sent it back and they sent a free replacement, and it was perfect.,I believe the bottle was handled fine, the only reason it had a scratch is because it doesn't come in a box or some type of bag or packaging. It's just the bottle by itself in the Amazon bag, which isn't very protective- especially when hitting all those bumps on the road or shipping to the destination."
BuzzieBee,"March 18, 2024","I have owned many water cups but I‚Äôve shunned the Stanley‚Äôs because of the hype surrounding them. I ordered this one after a close friend recommended this one because of the hardy top/handle.,I LOVE IT. The color is beautiful and bright. The top looks so cute with it.,The handle and top are well-made quite sturdy. They are heavier than some of my other types of cups. It is easy to wash and comes apart to wash easily. The straw is a good quality and seems like it will stay nice if I take good care of it.,The cup itself keeps my icy drink nice and cold all day. Because I ordered the 30 oz I have to refill it at lunch time.,Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this cup. It‚Äôs easy to carry throughout the day and it keeps my drinks cold."
Amy Fear,"February 20, 2024","The Stanley IceFlow Tumbler sets a new standard for convenience and functionality in beverage containers. Featuring a top handle design, it effortlessly outshines traditional tumblers with side handles, offering unparalleled versatility and ease of transport.,One of its standout features is the leak-proof design, ensuring that your beverage stays securely contained, even when you're on the move. The ability to close the mouthpiece adds an extra layer of protection against spills, allowing you to enjoy your drink without any worries.,The vibrant color adds a splash of personality to this already impressive tumbler, making it not just a practical accessory, but a stylish statement piece as well. The fact that you patiently waited two months for it to come back in stock speaks volumes about its desirability and quality.,In conclusion, the Stanley IceFlow Tumbler is well worth the wait. Its combination of versatile design, leak-proof construction, and eye-catching aesthetics make it an essential companion for anyone with an active lifestyle. Whether you're commuting, hiking, or simply out and about, this tumbler is sure to become your go-to choice for keeping your beverages at the perfect temperature while on the move."
Dulce,"March 4, 2024",Gave it four stars because it DOES leak. But I got it for my baby to carry for her warm water for her formula since she dislikes cold or room temperature. It keeps her water warm for about 9 hours. I like it minus the leaking but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. If you don‚Äôt mind the leaking I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty great size. Lasts me all day if we are out or visiting family.
dcongote,"March 12, 2024","I was a little worried when I bought it since a bunch of comments said that it arrived damaged. But omg, IT ARRIVED PERFECTLY! (almost). It only has microscopic scratches that are so hard to see. The handle arrived a little dirty but I washed it and it came off. I LOVE the rose gold. It‚Äôs more like a pale rose! I thought that a little bit of the logo would come off since it happened to certain persons. Over all I give it five stars!  love this ‚ù§Ô∏è"
H. Hamer aka: Sunshine,"March 16, 2024","Never tried Stanley until now.  Seriously takes keeping HOT... hot, and keeping COLD... cold.  I bought the large tumbler with straw due to my liking the straw feature however, you can take the straw off and just do the sipping, as with coffee.  Slender bottom allows you to place your mug inside your vehicle cup holder.  Flat base of mug is slippage proof, yet if you knock it hard enough it shall tumble.  I LOVE the fact that it can be cleaned in the Dish Washer.  Many of these Thermos Tumblers tell you NO dishwasher, yet this one comes out sanitized and does not lose it's color. I am a person who will drink half of whatever I have in the Thermos, put it down and come back to it later... sometimes hours later, and I honestly I like having what I left in the Thermos... either warm, or very cold.  When I mean warm, I mean as if I just microwaved it for 30 seconds.  I also love the top handle.  I can put it on my belt, or bike, or cart if needed.  Now I am going to look for the ones less than 30 ounces.  Happy Amazon Day."
Carla,"March 21, 2024","I was curious and bought into the hype.  Firstly, it was time for me to get a brand new container anyway, and wasn't compelled to buy anything for a few years and relied on water bottles instead.  There was all this buzz about the Stanley Cup.  I disregarded it because the style I saw on TikTok or YouTube or news article was the large cup with the large handle and long straw.  I couldn't bring myself to buy that! It looked so embarrassing and pretentious the way people--mostly those that looked like females--were carrying this style.  Looked like a bunch of Karens from all ethnicities, in my opinion.  Then I found one with a top handle, in all black including the Stanley logo.  So, I bought it.  It's simple, clean lines, doesn't stand out as pretentious and goes with my every day minimalist aesthetic.  I am happy with the quality, size and design!  I am glad Stanley offered this size, design and color."

Mary Alice,"February 17, 2024","in my opinion the best yet stanley tumbler. ‚ú® it‚Äôs made of recycled fishing nets (my biggest conservation interest), i adore the leak proof flip straw, it keeps my ice for 2 entire days, the 30oz is perfect if you‚Äôre petite/have small hands/aren‚Äôt very strong, the handle makes it easy to carry around everywhere, it holds ice to the top and a normal sized water bottle perfectly, the color selection is immaculate especially on amazon (i bought a second one in the plum stripe color tonight), and it‚Äôs sweat proof. next i think i‚Äôll be purchasing a 64oz in the charcoal or lavender just to have on hand for long trips, beach days, camping, etc.,i really can‚Äôt imagine a more perfect every day water bottle. the only con for me is they did that collab with starbucks in the beginning of this year and with the goings on in üáµüá∏ üçâ i really did not like that - if you know you know - but making this from the recycled fishing nets is really something im glad to support because saving our oceans and our planet is so important and i wish more big corporations would be willing to participate and do the same. the fishing industry and the nets they litter everywhere are the biggest cause of oceanic pollution, there‚Äôs millions of giant fishing vessels üö¢ net sweeping the entire ocean floor at every second of every day killing every animal caught inside including endangered & non target species such as dolphins, sea turtles, & thousands of others. this continuous hacking at our oceans has reduced our coral reef and fish populations along with algae production by 70% in the last 50 years (most of the worlds oxygen comes from algae). their nets are the number ONE source of plastic in our oceans making up 80% of the plastic found at sea (straws only make up 1% for reference). so thank you stanley for doing something helpful to our planet! üåé üåä"
Justin Nola,"March 22, 2024","Looks exactly like the picture, LEGIT BRAND!,Keeps my water cold for hours, sometimes more than a day depending on how cold the water I put in or how much ice I put in. The first bottle I got it had a small scratch, so I sent it back and they sent a free replacement, and it was perfect.,I believe the bottle was handled fine, the only reason it had a scratch is because it doesn't come in a box or some type of bag or packaging. It's just the bottle by itself in the Amazon bag, which isn't very protective- especially when hitting all those bumps on the road or shipping to the destination."
BuzzieBee,"March 18, 2024","I have owned many water cups but I‚Äôve shunned the Stanley‚Äôs because of the hype surrounding them. I ordered this one after a close friend recommended this one because of the hardy top/handle.,I LOVE IT. The color is beautiful and bright. The top looks so cute with it.,The handle and top are well-made quite sturdy. They are heavier than some of my other types of cups. It is easy to wash and comes apart to wash easily. The straw is a good quality and seems like it will stay nice if I take good care of it.,The cup itself keeps my icy drink nice and cold all day. Because I ordered the 30 oz I have to refill it at lunch time.,Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this cup. It‚Äôs easy to carry throughout the day and it keeps my drinks cold."
Amy Fear,"February 20, 2024","The Stanley IceFlow Tumbler sets a new standard for convenience and functionality in beverage containers.

The ability to close the mouthpiece adds an extra layer of protection against spills, allowing you to enjoy your drink without any worries.,The vibrant color adds a splash of personality to this already impressive tumbler, making it not just a practical accessory, but a stylish statement piece as well. The fact that you patiently waited two months for it to come back in stock speaks volumes about its desirability and quality.,In conclusion, the Stanley IceFlow Tumbler is well worth the wait. Its combination of versatile design, leak-proof construction, and eye-catching aesthetics make it an essential companion for anyone with an active lifestyle. Whether you're commuting, hiking, or simply out and about, this tumbler is sure to become your go-to choice for keeping your beverages at the perfect temperature while on the move."
Dulce,"March 4, 2024",Gave it four stars because it DOES leak. But I got it for my baby to carry for her warm water for her formula since she dislikes cold or room temperature. It keeps her water warm for about 9 hours. I like it minus the leaking but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. If you don‚Äôt mind the leaking I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty great size. Lasts me all day if we are out or visiting family.
dcongote,"March 12, 2024","I was a little worried when I bought it since a bunch of comments said that it arrived damaged. But omg, IT ARRIVED PERFECTLY! (almost). It only has microscopic scratches that are so hard to see. The handle arrived a little dirty but I washed it and it came off. I LOVE the rose gold. It‚Äôs more like a pale rose! I thought that a little bit of the logo would come off since it happened to certain persons. Over all I give it five stars!  love this ‚ù§Ô∏è"
H. Hamer aka: Sunshine,"March 16, 2024","Never tried Stanley until now.  Seriously takes keeping HOT... hot, and keeping COLD... cold.  I bought the large tumbler with straw due to my liking the straw feature however, you can take the straw off and just do the sipping, as with coffee.  Slender bottom allows you to place your mug inside your vehicle cup holder.  Flat base of mug is slippage proof, yet if you knock it hard enough it shall tumble.  I LOVE the fact that it can be cleaned in the Dish Washer.  Many of these Thermos Tumblers tell you NO dishwasher, yet this one comes out sanitized and does not lose it's color. I am a person who will drink half of whatever I have in the Thermos, put it down and come back to it later... sometimes hours later, and I honestly I like having what I left in the Thermos... either warm, or very cold.  When I mean warm, I mean as if I just microwaved it for 30 seconds.  I also love the top handle.  I can put it on my belt, or bike, or cart if needed.  Now I am going to look for the ones less than 30 ounces.  Happy Amazon Day."
Carla,"March 21, 2024","I was curious and bought into the hype.  Firstly, it was time for me to get a brand new container anyway, and wasn't compelled to buy anything for a few years and relied on water bottles instead.  There was all this buzz about the Stanley Cup.  I disregarded it because the style I saw on TikTok or YouTube or news article was the large cup with the large handle and long straw.  I couldn't bring myself to buy that! It looked so embarrassing and pretentious the way people--mostly those that looked like females--were carrying this style.  Looked like a bunch of Karens from all ethnicities, in my opinion.  Then I found one with a top handle, in all black including the Stanley logo.  So, I bought it.  It's simple, clean lines, doesn't stand out as pretentious and goes with my every day minimalist aesthetic.  I am happy with the quality, size and design!  I am glad Stanley offered this size, design and color."
