I bought the large tumbler with straw due to my liking the straw feature however, you can take the straw off and just do the sipping, as with coffee.  Slender bottom allows you to place your mug inside your vehicle cup holder.  Flat base of mug is slippage proof, yet if you knock it hard enough it shall tumble.  I LOVE the fact that it can be cleaned in the Dish Washer.  Many of these Thermos Tumblers tell you NO dishwasher, yet this one comes out sanitized and does not lose it's color. I am a person who will drink half of whatever I have in the Thermos, put it down and come back to it later... sometimes hours later, and I honestly I like having what I left in the Thermos... either warm, or very cold.  When I mean warm, I mean as if I just microwaved it for 30 seconds.  I also love the top handle.  I can put it on my belt, or bike, or cart if needed.  Now I am going to look for the ones less than 30 ounces.  Happy Amazon Day.\"]}\n"

Firstly, it was time for me to get a brand new container anyway, and wasn't compelled to buy anything for a few years and relied on water bottles instead.  There was all this buzz about the Stanley Cup.  I disregarded it because the style I saw on TikTok or YouTube or news article was the large cup with the large handle and long straw.  I couldn't bring myself to buy that! It looked so embarrassing and pretentious the way people--mostly those that looked like females--were carrying this style.  Looked like a bunch of Karens from all ethnicities, in my opinion.  Then I found one with a top handle, in all black including the Stanley logo.  So, I bought it.  It's simple, clean lines, doesn't stand out as pretentious and goes with my every day minimalist aesthetic.  I am happy with the quality, size and design!
